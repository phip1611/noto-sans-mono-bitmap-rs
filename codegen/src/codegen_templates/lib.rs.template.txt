//! Provides pre-rasterized characters from the "Noto Sans Mono" font in different sizes and font
//! weights for multiple unicode ranges. This crate is `no_std` and needs no allocations or floating
//! point operations. Useful in kernels and bootloaders when only "soft-float" is available. Strictly
//! speaking, this crate is more than a basic bitmap font, because it encodes each pixel as a byte
//! and not as a bit, which results in a much nicer result on the screen.
//!
//! * Original font files taken from: <https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Mono>
//! * License: SIL Open Font License (OFL) <https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL>
//!
//! ## TL;DR
//! * ✅ `no_std`, zero allocations, no floating point operations
//! * ✅ most important symbols, numbers, and letters as pre-rasterized constant. Unicode-ranges are selectable.
//! * ✅ Noto Sans Mono font as base
//! * ✅ different sizes and font weights (light, normal, bold)
//! * ✅ nice anti-aliasing/smoothing and better looking than legacy bitmap fonts
//! * ✅ every pixel is encoded in a byte (0-255) and not a bit, which results in a much nicer result on the screen.
//! * ✅ relevant font sizes, such as 14, 18, 22, and 32px (as optional build time features)
//! * ✅ zero dependencies
//! * ✅ All characters are aligned in their box/raster. If they are printed next to each other, the result looks nice.
//!
