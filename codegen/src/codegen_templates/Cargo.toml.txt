name = "noto-sans-mono-bitmap"
description = """
Provides pre-rasterized characters from the "Noto Sans Mono" font in different sizes and font
weights for multiple unicode ranges. This crate is `no_std` and needs no allocations or floating
point operations. Useful in kernels and bootloaders when only "soft-float" is available. Strictly
speaking, this crate is more than a basic bitmap font, because it encodes each pixel as a byte
and not as a bit, which results in a much nicer result on the screen.

[features]
# My testing showed that rustc reliably discards unused raster heights or font weights.
# However, to speed-up compilation, it's recommended to only use the default features
# and not include all of them all the time. Note that rustc can not easily discard unused
# unicode ranges if the input source theoretically allows the full u32-range.
