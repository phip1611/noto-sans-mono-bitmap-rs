name = "noto-sans-mono-bitmap"
description = """
Contains the "Noto Sans Mono" font as pre-rasterized bitmap font in different sizes and
font weights. This crate is `no_std` and needs no allocations or floating point operations.
Useful in kernels and bootloaders when only "soft-float" is available. Strictly speaking,
this crate is more than a basic bitmap font, because it encodes each pixel as a byte
and not as a bit, which results in a much nicer result on the screen.
